        "GPT can learn knowledge in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Via model weights (i.e., fine-tune the model on a training set)\n",
        "- Via model inputs (i.e., insert the knowledge into an input message)\n",
        "\n",
        "Although fine-tuning can feel like the more natural option—training on data is how GPT learned all of its other knowledge, after all—we generally do not recommend it as a way to teach the model knowledge. Fine-tuning is better suited to teaching specialized tasks or styles, and is less reliable for factual recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an analogy, model weights are like long-term memory. When you fine-tune a model, it's like studying for an exam a week away. When the exam arrives, the model may forget details, or misremember facts it never read.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, message inputs are like short-term memory. When you insert knowledge into a message, it's like taking an exam with open notes. With notes in hand, the model is more likely to arrive at correct answers.\n",
        "\n",

Better search systems might combine multiple search methods, along with features like popularity, recency, user history, redundancy with prior search results, click rate data, etc. Q&A retrieval performance may also be improved with techniques like [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496), in which questions are first transformed into hypothetical answers before being embedded. Similarly, GPT can also potentially improve search results by automatically transforming questions into sets of keywords or search terms."

Changes in Qualification: The qualifying process for curling and women\\'s ice hockey had to be altered due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event. The women\\'s tournament qualification was based on existing IIHF World Rankings.\\n\\n2. Biosecurity Protocols: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced biosecurity protocols for the Games, which included a \"closed-loop management system\" where athletes had to remain within a bio-secure bubble. Athletes were required to undergo daily COVID-19 testing and could only travel to and from Games-related venues. Only residents of China were allowed to attend the Games as spectators.\\n\\n3. NHL Player Withdrawal: The National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey League Players\\' Association (NHLPA) announced that NHL players would not participate in the men\\'s hockey tournament due to concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up postponed games.\\n\\n4. Limited Spectators: Ticket sales to the general public were canceled, and only limited numbers of spectators were admitted by invitation only. The Games were closed to the general public, with spectators only present at events held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou.\\n\\n5. Use of My2022 App: Everyone present at the Games, including athletes, staff, and attendees, were required to use the My2022 mobile app as part of the biosecurity protocols. The app was used for health reporting, COVID-19 vaccination and testing records, customs declarations, and messaging.\\n\\n6. Athlete Absences: Some top athletes, including Austrian ski jumper Marita Kramer and Russian skeletonist Nikita Tregubov, were unable to travel to China after testing positive for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic.\\n\\n7. COVID-19 Cases: There were a total of 437 COVID-19 cases linked to the 2022 Winter Olympics, with 171 cases among the COVID-19 protective bubble residents and the rest detected through airport testing of games-related arrivals.\\n\\nPlease note that this answer is based on the provided articles and may not include all possible impacts of COVID-19 on the 2022 Winter Olympics.'"
